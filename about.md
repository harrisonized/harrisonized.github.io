title: About Harrison
---

Welcome to my blog!

I come from humble beginnings at the University of California, San Diego, where I double-majored in Physics and Neuroscience. Prior to becoming a data scientist, I worked as a researcher in biology for five years, gaining expertise in the fields of RNA Biology and Immunology.

I think my greatest asset is my multidisciplinary background, because it enables me to see scientific problems from a vantage point that is distinct from my colleagues', and this sometimes enables me to come up with the best approaches to solve them. Also, because of the specialized nature of my research, I have also developed the skills necessary to explain complicated topics to a more non-technical audience in a way that conveys the main point while still preserving the details.

Please feel free to explore the rest of my [blog](https://harrisonized.github.io/archive) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonized) and reach out to me at harrison.c.wang@gmail.com with any job opportunities or questions. Happy reading!
