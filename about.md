After working in RNA biology and immunology in the wet lab for 5 years, I studied at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) to make the transition to dry lab. As a Data Scientist in the Dry Lab Operations team at Invitae, I combined my dedication to write maintainable code (Python, SQL, and Datalog) with my domain knowledge of biology to create software solutions for monitoring and troubleshooting next-generation sequencing operations. For more information on my career trajectory, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonized).

The purpose of this blog is to showcase completed data projects that I am particularly proud of, If you are currently a data science student, you have my permission to reproduce any part of my projects, including file organization, code, or explanations, as long as you give me due credit. Also, please feel free to [email me](mailto:harrison.c.wang@gmail.com) if you would like to chat.

Happy reading!
