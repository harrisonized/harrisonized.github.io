After working in RNA biology and immunology in the wet lab for 5 years, I studied at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) to make the transition to dry lab. For more information on my career trajectory, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonized).

The purpose of my blog is to showcase completed data science projects and share helpful hints for people looking to break into the field. If you are currently a data science student, you have my permission to reproduce any part of my projects, including file organization, code, or explanations, as long as you give me due credit. Feel free to [email me](mailto:harrison.c.wang@gmail.com) if you encounter any issues or would like to chat about data science.

Happy reading!
