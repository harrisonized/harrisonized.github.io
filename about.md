title: About Harrison
---

I studied at the University of California, San Diego, where I double-majored in Physics and Neuroscience. After working as a researcher in RNA biology and immunology, I studied at Metis to become a data scientist. The purpose of this blog is to showcase the data projects I have completed. If you are currently a data science student, please feel free to reproduce any part of my projects, including file organization, code, or explanations.

As a data scientist, I believe my greatest asset is my multidisciplinary background, because this has enabled me to see scientific problems or engineering challenges from multiple angles to find the best solution. Furthermore, having been in specialized research for so long, I have developed skills in teaching technical topics to non-technical people.

Please feel free to explore the rest of my [blog](https://harrisonized.github.io/archive) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonized), and [email me](mailto:harrison.c.wang@gmail.com) with any questions. Happy reading!
