title: About Harrison
---

I studied at the University of California, San Diego, where I double-majored in Physics and Neuroscience. After working as a researcher in RNA biology and immunology, I studied at Metis to become a data scientist. The purpose of this blog is to showcase the data projects I have completed. If you are currently a student in data science, please feel free to reproduce any part of my projects, including file organization, code, or explanations.

I am actively seeking a role in which I can help you solve your research and business problems through the application of machine learning. If you are a recruiter, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:harrison.c.wang@gmail.com) if you would like to chat. My LinkedIn is available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonized). Happy reading!
