title: About Harrison
---

I studied at the University of California, San Diego, where I double-majored in Physics and Neuroscience. After working in RNA biology and immunology in the wet lab, I studied at Metis to pivot my career, and now I am a Data Scientist in the Dry Lab Operations team at Invitae. For more information on my career trajectory, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonized).

The purpose of this blog is to showcase completed data projects and publish materials that you might find helpful. If you are currently a data science student, you have my permission to reproduce any part of my projects, including file organization, code, or explanations, as long as you give me due credit. Also, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:harrison.c.wang@gmail.com) if you would like schedule time to chat.

Happy reading!
