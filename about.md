Hello, and welcome to my blog! I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [NIH-Penn Immunology Graduate Partnership Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/nih-igg-partnership/), and I am interested in the early development of autoimmune diseases.

I had a non-traditional path for reaching where I am today. I joined my first research lab in May 2013, working under the tutelage of Fernando Martinez, a Ph.D. student at the time. While I was there, I worked on ALS and CRISPR/Cas9, and in doing so, gained competency in wet lab skills, such as cloning, tissue culture, qPCR, and assay development. From 2017 to 2019, I worked at True North Therapeutics, where I studied diseases of the complement immune system, many of which were autoimmune diseases. For example, our lead antibody drug, sutimlimab (TNT009), was granted [FDA approval](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-rare-type-anemia) on February 4, 2022 for the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD), an autoimmune disease in which patients have complement-activating IgM autoantibodies to their own red blood cells, which causes anemia and drastically lowers patientsâ€™ quality of life. It was because of my work here that I first became interested in autoimmune diseases. I also began dabbling in Python programming.

In 2019, I enrolled in [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/), a 12-week data science bootcamp focused on machine learning and data analysis and visualization, with the goal of transitioning to a dry lab role. I achieved that milestone when in January 2020, I became a Data Scientist at Invitae, a clinical genomics company. I handled ad-hoc root cause analyses of customer issues arising from our next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays, and I built dashboards using Tableau to monitor new assays. In 2021, I joined Thermo-Fisher as an R&D Data Scientist, where my main project was the epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 variants using customer datasets from our TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit. Because I joined close to the founding of our team, I had the opportunity to lay the foundation for our pipeline: using Python and SQL, I engineered a scalable, extract-transform-load (ETL) pipeline in a AWS to extract information from customer files and load transformed, tabular data into an Amazon Athena database for consumption by our Power BI dashboard. I also handled ad-hoc analyses, such as analyzing the outcomes of sample repeats.

This blog features the portfolio I created during my education at Metis, any software-related topics I learned during my journey, and any technical topics I find interesting. For a detailed summary of my experiences, please see my [extended-resume](https://harrisonized.github.io/resume/harrison-wang-extended-resume.pdf).
