Hello, and welcome to my blog! I am currently a first year Immunology Ph.D. student in the [NIH-Penn Immunology Graduate Partnership Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/nih-igg-partnership/), and I am broadly interested in autoimmunity.

I joined my first research lab in May 2013, working under the tutelage of Fernando Martinez, a Ph.D. student at the time. While I was there, I worked on ALS and CRISPR/Cas9, and in doing so, gained competency in most of my wet lab biology skills, such as cloning, tissue culture, qPCR, and assay development.

From 2017 to 2019, I worked at True North Therapeutics, where I studied diseases of the complement immune system, many of which were autoimmune diseases. For example, our lead antibody drug, sutimlimab (TNT009), was granted [FDA approval](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-rare-type-anemia) on February 4, 2022 for the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD), an autoimmune disease in which patients have IgM (complement-activating) antibodies to their own red blood cells, which causes anemia and drastically lowers patients' quality of life. Because of my work here, I became interested in the immune system and autoimmunity. I also dabbled in Python programming.

In 2019, I enrolled in [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/), a 12-week data science bootcamp that focused on machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization, with the goal of transitioning to the dry lab. In 2020, I achieved that milestone when I became a Data Scientist at Invitae, a clinical genomics company. I handled ad-hoc root cause analyses of customer issues arising from our next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays, and I built Tableau dashboards to monitor new assays.

In 2021, I joined Thermo-Fisher as an R&D Data Scientist, where my main project was the epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 variants using customer datasets from our TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit. Because I joined close to the founding of our team, I had the opportunity to lay the foundation for our pipeline: using Python and SQL, I engineered a scalable, extract-transform-load (ETL) pipeline in a AWS to extract information from customer files and load transformed, tabular data into an Amazon Athena database for consumption by our Power BI dashboard. I also handled a few ad-hoc analyses, such as analyzing the outcomes of sample repeats.

In my Ph.D., I aim to use both my wet lab and dry lab skills to conduct research in autoimmunity. I am currently doing my first rotation in the [Michela Locci's lab](https://www.loccilab.com/), where I my main project will be on the role of Activin A in autoimmunity. The original purpose of this blog was to showcase my completed data science projects, but moving forward, I will write about anything technical that I feel is important. For a detailed summary of my experiences, please see my [extended-resume](https://harrisonized.github.io/resume/harrison-wang-extended-resume.pdf).

Happy reading!
