title: About Harrison
---

After working in RNA biology and immunology in the wet lab for 5 years, I studied at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) to make the transition to dry lab. In my latest role as a Data Scientist in the Dry Lab Operations team at Invitae, I combined my dedication to write maintainable code (Python, SQL, and Datalog) with my domain knowledge of biology to create software solutions for monitoring and troubleshooting next-generation sequencing operations. For more information on my career trajectory, please see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonized).

The purpose of my blog is to showcase my portfolio of completed data projects by making them understandable to the average reader. All code I wrote for these projects is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/harrisonized?tab=repositories), which (as of September 2020) is a faithful representation of my coding abilities and preferred organizational style for coding projects.

If you are currently a data science student, you have my permission to reproduce any part of my projects, including file organization, code, or explanations, as long as you give me due credit.
