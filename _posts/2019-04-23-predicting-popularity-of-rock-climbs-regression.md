title: Predicting Popularity of Rock Climbs

[Github Repository](https://github.com/harrisonized/predicting-popularity-of-rock-climbs-regression)

This is a placeholder for Project 2 until I complete my write-up.

For this project, I used count data from [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/) to predict the number of users who have a rock climb on their to-do-list. My final model is an optimized weighted ensemble of Poisson and log-linear regression, which improved the out-of-sample test score (R^2) to 0.842 from 0.643 of the baseline linear regression model. The same strategy can be used to predict the number of people who would have an item in their online shopping-list.
