This is a placeholder for Project 1 until I complete my write-up.



This was the first project assigned at Metis. The purpose was to become familiar with some tools used in exploratory data analysis using Python, which includes the following:

1. Web scraping using BeautifulSoup
2. Data cleaning and analysis using Pandas
3. Visualization using Matplotlib.
