title: Predicting Popularity of Rock Climbs
---

As classes are winding down, I've had time to revisit and improve upon some of my earlier projects. This is a placeholder for Project 2 until I complete my write-up. For now, please visit my [Github repository](https://github.com/harrisonized/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Predicting%20Popularity%20of%20Rock%20Climbs) for a quick summary of the work. If you were redirected here from the Github repository, I apologize for the delay.
