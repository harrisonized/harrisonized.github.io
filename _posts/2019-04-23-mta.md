Hello, and welcome to my blog!

This first blog post is a high-level overview of my first and only group project at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/). I was partnered up with fellow students [Adi Guar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaur1/) and [Genevieve McGuire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevieve-mcguire/) on Monday, the first day of the boot camp. After being given brief instructions (reproduced below) and a due date of Friday, which wasn't much time at all, we got to work right away.



"WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.

Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to **use MTA subway data**, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to **help us optimize the placement of our street teams**, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us."



Since the main purpose was to get to know our fellow students and become familiar with some tools used in [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), rather than giving a deep-dive into the details of the operation in this blog post, I just wanted to briefly summarize some of the main things that happened during this project.

First, we made a group [Github repository](https://github.com/metis-sf-spring-2019-project-1/MTA_Data_Analysis), although we didn't end up making much use of it. We divided the tasks as follows. My task was to [scrape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) the [MTA website](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), Genevieve was responsible for the [data cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing) after the data is successfully downloaded, and Adi was responsible for building the plotting tools using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and getting GPS coordinates of tech hubs. This is what we had discussed on Monday. However, reality worked out differently, and I ended up pulling an all-nighter on Thursday. We put together a presentation Friday morning and somehow received a passing score despite presenting on no sleep with little preparation.

After the project, I felt was unsatisfied with much of the code that I had written, so I wanted to clean it up just on the small chance that I ever revisited this project in the future. I also didn't want to showcase haphazard code on my github if it didn't represent a genuine effort to make it as good as possible. Hence, I made [my own github repository](https://github.com/harrisonized/mta) and rewrote much of the code to the best of my ability to follow best practices, including things like wrapping repetitive code in functions, making sure my variable names made sense, hash commenting sections and lines of code that could potentially be confusing, and conforming to the lower-case and dashes convention for filenames.

This ended up working out to my benefit. My science background has taught me that good documentation is key to remembering projects long after they have been forgotten, and sure enough, rewriting my code for this project has helped me to follow best practices for my other projects as well.

Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for updates on future projects!
