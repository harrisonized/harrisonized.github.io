Hello, and welcome to my blog!

This first blog post is a high-level overview of my first and only group project at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/). I was partnered up with fellow students [Adi Guar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaur1/) and [Genevieve McGuire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevieve-mcguire/) on Monday, the first day of the boot camp. After being given brief instructions (reproduced below) and a due date of Friday, which wasn't much time at all, we got to work right away.



"WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.

Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to **use MTA subway data**, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to **help us optimize the placement of our street teams**, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us."



Since the main purpose was to get to know our fellow students and become familiar with some tools used in [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), rather than giving a deep-dive into the details, which are available on my [Github README](https://github.com/harrisonized/mta/blob/master/README.md), I just wanted to briefly summarize our efforts and what I learned from this project.

First, we made a group [Github repository](https://github.com/metis-sf-spring-2019-project-1/MTA_Data_Analysis), then we divided the tasks. I was responsible for [scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) the [MTA website](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). Genevieve was responsible for the [data cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing) after the data is successfully downloaded, and Adi was responsible for building the plotting tools using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and getting GPS coordinates of tech hubs. This is what we had discussed on Monday.

However, reality worked out differently. We ended up not using the Github repository much, except to upload our completed work after the project was due. A lot of the code was written haphazardly with the goal only to get the results and not necessarily to be able to reuse it. I ended up pulling an all-nighter on Thursday. We put together a presentation Friday morning and somehow received a passing score despite presenting on no sleep with little preparation.

After the project due date, I wanted to clean up the code and write comments to help me remember what we accomplished. Furthermore, since one of the bootcamp goals is to produce a worthy project portfolio, I wanted to be able to showcase work that I am proud of, and I also wanted to get better at writing code in general for future projects. Finally, if I had good organization, then I would be able to reuse my code for future projects.

Therefore, I made [my own github repository](https://github.com/harrisonized/mta) and tried, to the best of my ability, to follow best practices. These included the following:

1. Renaming variable names to be descriptive
2. Hash commenting lines of code that may be confusing to others
3. Rewriting repetitive code in functions
4. Using [return statements](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/global_&_return.html) rather than declaring global variables for functions
5. Conforming to the [lower-case and dashes convention](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html) for folders and filenames
6. Committing files to git to track differences, instead of creating new files with the edits

This ended up working out to my benefit. Having been in science for the last five years, I knew that proper documentation is so important to making certain that the project is done correctly. Since my code was clean and understandable to me, I was able to reuse certain sections for future projects, which was a great time-saver.

Thank you for reading, and stay tuned for updates on future projects!
