Hello, and welcome to my blog!

This first blog post is a walk-through of my first project assigned at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/). The purpose was to get to know our fellow students and become familiar with some tools used in [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis). The project was assigned on Monday, April 1st, and due on Friday. I was partnered up with [Adi Guar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaur1/) and [Genevieve McGuire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevieve-mcguire/), and after being given the following instructions, we got to work right away.

"WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.

Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to **use MTA subway data**, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to **help us optimize the placement of our street teams**, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us."

After dividing up the work, we made a group [Github](https://github.com/metis-sf-spring-2019-project-1/MTA_Data_Analysis), and my task was to [scrape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) the [MTA website](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).



After the project, I felt was unsatisfied with much of the code that I had written, so I sought to clean it up. Hence, I made my own github repository and rewrote the code to my satisfaction. This ended up working out to my benefit. My science background has taught me that good documentation is so important.
