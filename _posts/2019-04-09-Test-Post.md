title: My First Week at Metis
---

Metis is flying by quickly. It's already Tuesday, and in this span of time, I've completed a data analytics project, set up this blog, and met a lot of very nice people.

This is just a test post, so for now, here's my to-do list:

1. Set up the blog.
2. Finish some loose ends on Project 1 and post it onto here.
3. Start Project 2.
