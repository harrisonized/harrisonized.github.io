title: My First Week at Metis
---

Metis is flying by quickly. It's already Day 7, and I already feel behind. The work is piling on.

Things currently on my to-do list:

1. Update this blog.
2. Finish some loose ends on Project 1 and post it onto this blog. See [Github Post]("https://github.com/metis-sf-spring-2019-project-1/MTA_Data_Analysis").
3. Figure out what to do for Project 2.
4. Figure out what to do for the "Investigations" project. Must do two by Week 12.
